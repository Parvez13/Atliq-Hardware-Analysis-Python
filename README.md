# :computer: Atliq Hardware Business Analysis

## :memo: Problem Statement

Atliq Hardware is one of the leading computer hardware producers in India and well expanded in other countries too.

However, despite their growth, the management has identified a critical gap in their ability to extract actionable insights from their vast and diverse datasets. This lack of timely and informed decision-making has created challenges in addressing dynamic business needs effectively.

To bridge this gap, the analytics team at Atliq Hardwares has compiled a series of ad-hoc business questions from various domains, including product analysis, customer behaviour, and sales performance. These questions aim to uncover key trends and drive data-backed decision-making.
